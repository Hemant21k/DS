YouTube UC Berkeley CS61B with Jonathan Shewchuk for a less rigorous explanation of all the core Data Structures (and some more advanced Data Structures like Splay Trees which aren't covered in CLRS).

YouTube Erik Demaine - Dynamic Programming for an easier explanation of  dynamic programming.

YouTube Tim Roughgarden's explanations for Greedy proofs to get a better understanding on that.  (I didn't understand the greedy proofs at all when I read them in the book)

YouTube 0612 TV (lcc0612) for super simplified, intuitive explanations of sorting algorithms.
